# Energy-Consumption

This project involves predicting energy consumption based on time series data on weather. We are given 8 different rooms with temperature and humidity stats for each. We are also given outside weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed), as well as time information (month, date, hour). Energy consumption is measured in Watts / hour in 10 minute intervals. 

The dataset is available in the energy_usage.csv file. Feature descriptions are in the "Data Set Description.txt" file. 

Full notebook can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hjhuney/Energy-Consumption/blob/master/energy_usage_analysis.ipynb) file.
